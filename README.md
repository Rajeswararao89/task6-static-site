# 📄 Task 6 – Host a Static Website with GitHub Pages

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this task was to **deploy a static website** using GitHub Pages.  
I went beyond the basic HTML example and developed a **fully responsive personal portfolio site** to demonstrate my skills as a DevOps Engineer.

## 🛠 What I Did
1. **Designed and built a modern portfolio website**
   - Single `index.html` file with HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript
   - Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Smooth scroll animations using **AOS.js**
   - Light/Dark mode toggle

2. **Added professional sections**
   - **Home** – Intro with name & role
   - **About** – Career summary
   - **Skills** – Full list of DevOps tools
   - **Projects** – Placeholder projects to be updated with real work
   - **Contact** – Working contact form via Formspree
   - **Footer** – Social links (LinkedIn, GitHub)

3. **Integrated a working contact form**
   - Used **Formspree** for serverless email handling
   - Configured form endpoint for real-time message sending

4. **Deployed on GitHub Pages**
   - Pushed project to a public GitHub repository
   - Configured Pages to serve from `main` branch, root folder
   - Verified live site link
